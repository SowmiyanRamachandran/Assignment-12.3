1. What is meant by FlumeNG? 

Apache Flume is a reliable,distributed and available system for efficiently collecting, aggregating and moving large amounts of log data
from many different sources to a centralized data store. At a high-level, Flume NG uses a single-hop message delivery guarantee semantics
to provide end-to-end reliability for the system.

2. Can Flume provides 100 % reliability to the data flow? 

Yes, It provides End to end reliability of the flow. By Default Flume uses a transactional approach in the data flow.
Sources and sinks are encapsulated in a transactional repository provided by the channels.
These channels are responsible to pass the data reliably from end to end in the flow. So it provides 100% reliability in  the data flow.  

3. Can Flume can distributes data to multiple destinations? 

Yes, It supports Multiplexing flow.The Event flows from one source to multiple channels and multiple destinations.
It is achieved by defining a flow multiplexer.

4. Explain about the different channel types in Flume. And which channel type is faster?

•	MEMORY Channel – Events are read from the source into memory and passed to the sink.
•	JDBC Channel – JDBC Channel stores the events in an embedded Derby database.
•	FILE Channel –File Channel writes the contents to a file on the file system after reading the event from a source.
MEMORY Channel is the fastest channel among the three however has the risk of data loss.
The file is deleted only after the contents are successfully delivered to the sink.
The channel that you choose completely depends on the nature of the big data application and the value of each event.
